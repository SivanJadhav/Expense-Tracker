# Expense Tracker 🏦💰

A simple **command-line expense tracker** that supports **persistent storage** using JSON files. This project marks a significant milestone in my programming journey, as it introduced me to **file handling, user input validation, and data persistence** in Python. 🚀

## 📌 Features
- **Add Expenses**: Enter amount, category, and date to track your expenses.
- **View Expenses**: See a detailed list of your expenses with a total amount spent.
- **View Total by Category**: Get a breakdown of expenses by category.
- **Remove Expenses**: Delete specific expenses while maintaining data integrity.
- **Persistent Storage**: Expenses are saved to a JSON file, ensuring data is retained across sessions.

## 🏆 Achievements
- Implemented **file-based persistence**, transitioning from volatile memory to permanent storage.
- Used **JSON for data storage**, handling encoding/decoding and error recovery.
- Improved **input validation**, ensuring robust user interaction.
- Applied **enumeration and list operations**, learning how to manage dynamic lists efficiently.
- Designed a **modular code structure** (`main.py`, `file_io.py`, `get.py`) for better maintainability.

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SivanJadhav/Expense-Tracker.git
   cd expense-tracker
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to add, view, and manage expenses.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core Logic)
- **JSON** (Data Persistence)
